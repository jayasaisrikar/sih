0,,Next vid we’ll have a chill time going through this video point-for-point and talking about how we can do the opposite :),Positive
1,@dollarsaurus01,Man… this one really hit me hard. By the end of it I wanted to cry. I felt like I was watching a recap of my own life over the past year and realized how much of a negative attitude I’ve adopted about everything. So well done. Thanks Joey,Positive
2,@sinsocial3609,It’s crazy how everyone could relate with this video. I hope everyone gets on their path and be the best they could possibly be. We got this,Positive
3,@JakulaithWolff,"Thank you. Just to add to this motivational ride, nothing is ever too late to change. Literally last week I decided to change before the new year starts (It’s December), and just like that, I don’t smoke anymore and I’ve pushed myself to meet up events after a long isolation I blamed ‘trauma’ for. I just poured out my glass of wine after this video. I have to inspire myself if I want to inspire othwrs.",Negative
4,@HackieYT,"I'm SO glad I turned my life around the past year. My life used to be just like this, and seeing it from another perspective is confronting. Maybe even more confronting than when I confronted myself at the start of 2023. Keep going lads, you got this in the bag!",Positive
5,@antoniolarizza3232,"Hey, I wanna say: thank you for making this. Genuinely puts a lot of what I’m doing and a lot of how I act into perspective. Coming from experience doing most of these things, this is 100% how you ruin your life, and it’s a slow and painful process that feels like when an inexperienced hunter shoots a deer wrong, and has to gather up all the bits of their courage just to clumsily and hesitatingly finish it off, putting it in more pain than it already is. I wanna see the next video :)",Neutral
6,@IanK369,"Deep down I know I can't really blame my lack of success on being abused as a small child, but man, overcoming negative programming from age 5 has been a lifelong struggle.",Negative
7,@marcogranston935,This was a masterpiece!! The acting from all the actors was very good. The way they convey emotions so subtly really makes the impact of the video more poignant. You should think about releasing a full feature film covering many different topics including what results from living your life a certain way. Thanks again.,Positive

9,@THEcowboy367,"I needed this. I clicked into this thinking that I knew better than this, but no. Some parts where just spot on with how I've been after graduating from school. I got a life ahead of me, but I feel stumped by the lack of direction and quidance where to go from now. Nothing is going to happen, if I just crawl in my own space and insecurities.",Positive
10,@makaylaalexis4596,"The production of this video is unreal, you’ve seriously grown so much over the years and it’s inspiring to watch. The content was amazing as always. It really shows us how so many things we assume to be “givens” are actually in our control.",Positive
11,@misakiinuko8129,"Casually stumbled upon this video during my daily yt scrolling due to being homestuck for a surgery. I admit that it was really hard to watch it to the point I had to pause the video more than once - the reason: it called me out in such a way that made me wake up from my current slumber. Of course I am aware from a long time that this behavior has already damaged my social skills,  but the worst thing is that I keep blaming my past traumas for that instead of my cowardice and lack of will. Using them as a shield to protect myself from further harm at the price of being considered as a strange, if not crazy, outcast... And the fact that I'm a procrastinator doesn't help at all. Thank you for this video. Not sure if I'll be able to change for the better, but I sincerely want to try again - especially now that there will be some important changes in my life.",Positive
12,@jeonyn7309,This video made me realize my mistakes. Having an external locus of control and always making excuses for myself such as this situation was not in favorable circumstances and just wishing for a better future. I'll try my best to work on it :),Positive
13,@vCuda,"Absolutely soul crushing. Thanks man, genuinely. Deep down we're all aware of what we're doing to keep ourselves unhappy and in an endless cycle, but choose not to act. I've been dealing with the consequences of this recently but in that time, I remembered a quote from a childhood movie. I think it's something many of us have forgotten.",Positive
14,@mikealalee2889,"As someone who has Audhd, this is exactly how I live my life just to feel safe and comfortable in a world that's very scary and uncomfortable for me. This is a ruined life for some, but for me its happiness. Its peace. Its the freedom to be myself without others judging me simply for being born different.",Positive
15,@valvo3389,I’ve always been doing these things subconsciously without knowing and then blamed everyone around me as to why I felt unlikeable so I’m glad I found this video and hopefully I’ll change.,Positive
16,@babyyoda9943,"I feel like this year i have improved a lot physically and in some ways mentally, but also in other ways i have gotten even worse. Despite the improvements, i also hate myself for some things i have done and can’t take back. I hope you guys are doing better than me ",Negative
17,@collateral7925,For people who recognize themselves in this: it may be hard to change at first because the behavior is persistent and likely to return. Therefore place yourself in situations in which you are with your back against the wall and you only have the possibility to move forward and it's on you to make it happen. Then use the same force that held you back to push you through the hard times instead. This works best if you are in a new environment.,Positive
18,@mrlaserboy,"About one to two years ago (even tho it seems way longer) i realized how self destructive my every day behaviour was and I doubted that i could escape the cycle and maybe even fail the final exams of school. I didnt follow a comcrete strategy to get out of it but i was more and more confronted with my fault which lead to me simply changing my life bit by bit and every bit i got more content. I found motivation in music, just playing for myself und practicing for hours every day and now Im in a band with my best friends, struggle but manage my first semester at uni and am just happy in general. The key is thinking and reflecting... so many times i was just mad at myself for doing something bad or being lazy until I just stopped more and more. And when you realise the improvement, it automatically becomes a habit to just reflect more about yourself that the outside world and how to adapt yourself to being more happy with whaz you give and what you get... ",Positive
19,@nasos683,"This is so powerful. The funny thing is, telling someone how TO ruin their life as if they should do it is actually more powerful and shocking than telling them how NOT to. A genius idea, presented with exceptional footage.",Positive
20,@builderphill1361,I love this video and greatly appreciate the message given. You've helped me recognize many bad habits I have and have helped me recollect and correct my errors and helped me live a better life.,Positive
21,@13984980,"Turning 29 soon. Friends have moved on whether they’re doing better and or worse. All I think now to myself is all the time lost in chasing highs in my early to mid 20’s when I was with them. I know it’s not too late since I have no kids to add more weight to myself so no worries there, however this sense of loneliness can be quite humbling and or mentally crippling depending on your point of view. Great video, 2024 is the year to work harder and learn more skills for myself so 10 years from now I’ll hopefully be living comfortable.",Positive
22,@bigboybaxxo9024,"It’s funny because I relate to this but I don’t at the same time. I try to improve myself and I actively do every day. It’s incredibly easy to live like this though, and if I don’t actively make good choices I fall back into this type of behavior. You gotta remember that truly you can do anything, but you just gotta have the dedication to make it happen.",Positive
23,@HyperKilljoy112,"This video really had me feeling the chills. Hearing point after point, and realizing how it’s applicable just made me feel more guilt.",Positive
24,@austenmarais,"the first couple felt very familiar to me, but luckily as the video went on i began to be thankful i havent let myself go too far. good luck to anyone else working on making their dreams come true️",Positive
25,@emirmontazeri,"For a long time, I always thought ""I never planned to be here."" Only now to realize that is the exact reason I am where I never wanted to be. The plan that I chose was ""Not planning at all"". Procrastination, destructive habits, pointless daydreaming, etc are the things that got me here. Inaction paired with negative self-talk is a genuine slow death.",Negative
26,@zack6012,"I really liked the part about being late. I used to notice this with myself and more so with my other coworkers. I used to not like making small talk, but being early does make you look better. I still have friends and coworkers who are scared to be early to anything even social gatherings. god forbid you be the first person to the bar and you have to sit by yourself for a bit. some think no one is coming at all and they're just at the bar by themselves. Who cares? be fine being by yourself. you miss out on so much otherwise. I had so many plans with friends fall through because no one wanted to be the first one somewhere. we were all ina  group chat waiting for someone to say ""on my way"" or ""I'm there"" before we went out the door. I found a lot more success getting people together If I just told people ""I'm going out for a drink, feel free to join"". Someone usually showed up. If not that wasn't a big deal I could still have a drink and just leave, maybe meet some new people.",Positive
27,@yoblades,"I like how this film informs of all of the things that may negatively impact your social life - However, this can give the illusion that everything for the sake of your mental health is in your own control. Mental disorders such as social anxiety, bpd, aspd, etc are very real things and convincing yourself that you can overcome social and mental struggles yourself does not work for everyone. I’ve dealt with this myself. Getting professional help and regularly talking with someone should be first on the list to prevent all of the things that happened in this film.",Positive
28,@FnBaran,These type videos really motivates me to change my life for the better. I’m very grateful for this reminder to improve my life in different ways ,Positive
29,@butterscotchwm,"The bit about being closed off in public and not talking to anyone out of fear of an awkward interaction is the one I'm the biggest offender of. I'm more comfortable interacting with people I see regularly and don't like spontaneous human interaction. For some reason that's really difficult for me, but ever since the pandemic I've been forced to try to learn, because I no longer have a school or office setting to see the same faces every day. I've also been allowing myself to be a couple minutes late to zoom meetings more and more, justifying it by telling myself ""it's basically the same time, they won't care and it doesn't matter."" But these little things can give off a ""vibe"" that you are scatterbrained or under-prepared. You could be a good worker, but you might not be the first person someone recommends anymore.",Positive
30,@olegghansen,"Bullet points for NOT ruining your life: 

- Step 1: Maintain open body language, stand tall, make eye contact, and engage in social interactions to appear welcoming and receptive.",Positive
31,@Maze305,I was definitely in a spot like this for a short period not too long ago .  This was spot on. Humbling myself to prayer instead of on just wishing for good things to happen and having a little more gratitude for the good things/relationships with people that I have in my life has gone a long way.  I’m not there yet but really trying daily to not be so closed off and negative. I think it really does start with practicing improving on the things you named here. Great video,Positive
32,@0xroute,"Absolutely excellent video, both in message and cinematography. No further words dude, holy shit... This actually just motivated me to start filming stuff myself.",Positive
33,@erin7523,"Some of these I can most certainly work on. The rest of them, I'm actually content with being and don't allow them to make me miserable or ruin my life. I'm very methodical about the people i invite into my life. Not having friends is not a bad thing nor is it a big deal. I'm a very personable individual, there's just many reasons why I'm ok with being on my own.",Positive
34,@congee9417,"I love following your advice, it’s one of the few that actually seems to make some difference in my life. I guess it’s just the part where I act upon good words but your content is very in tune with the way I have lived before. Thanks betterideas, I forgot your name I apologise for that fact, I love the theme of your content, keep growing!",Positive
35,@the_fitness_doc,"What a brilliant, powerful, amazing message. Such a different perspective by reversing it, but so potent in how it wakes you up. Thank you for this. A masterpiece.",Positive
36,@tombensonfilms,"Mate! For me, from a filmmaking standpoint, this is the best video you've ever made - and that was a high bar to beat! You can tell you really put a lot of hard work into this and it definitely paid off. Nice one man ",Positive
37,@schooper.,"Great vid, thankfully a few years ago I pulled myself out of not taking responsibility for my own actions and to not blame everything on others. I learned it the hard way…but I changed and still work on it every day. However the first few points about shutting down and avoiding human interaction at all costs is crippling me. I’m going to work on changing that, so thank you. Same with talking negatively about others, I do that wayyyy too much especially at work. ",Positive
38,@gobblegamerxxx110,Step 1-4 is literally what I have been doing ever since I came to uni and long before that too. this video was a great eye opener for me. Will try to be better from now onwards,Positive

41,@zeduck415,"To contradict some of these:
don't look for validation. Don't show up late, it makes you stand out. Don't steal the spotlight, then you have to talk to people. Don't make excuses. You wouldn't want to be known as the person who makes excuses. You don't want to be known at all.",Negative

47,@chaotically-moon,"I’m glad since the last  video teaching me how to be miserable, I can say I don’t relate anymore :). I’m so proud of myself, thank you, Joey.",Positive
48,@DanilsonCarvalho,"God, this video is art. Your cinematography is nothing to scoff at, mate. You know, I sometimes worry about just how much subtlety I'm missing out on. Kind of like the anxiety of knowing you'll never read enough books. And all I can say is youve successfully induced that anxiety in me with this piece, which is a good thing. The aspect ratio immediately draws the eyes, the introduction of green into the black and white video during the sponsored section makes it really pop and stand out with a unique color profile for the shots, also obviously symbolizes health and vitality with the more layered message of ""Hey, if you focus more on your health, you introduce the color green into your life"" which immediately leads me to think thats the guiding light behind your color side of videos. ""Living bad makes the world grey, living better introduces color back, with every facet of life being a different color introduced back into your lens"".",Positive
49,@PaulYuNow,"I enjoy these videos of yours and their counterparts Joey, and I am curious as to why you decided to shoot one ultrawide and this one square. Maybe because this one is in black and white and the square ratio gives a more old film feeling? Anyways, looking forward to your next counterpart video! Thanks for these Joey.",Positive

54,@ChillySnail-xu4eu,"This is incredibly powerful. I feel like you could make a full length anti-film, if that makes sense? Like using this negative technique in order to make people realise their current lifestyle choices. It really puts your mindset back in the present time.",Positive
55,@benkeefe7594,i think it’s so profound and interesting that the ideas of self put forth in this video often contradict one another — “believe you are never at fault” and “believe you are unredeemable and bad”. an unhealthy relationship with yourself is often full of contradictions about self image,Negative

My self-worth is the lowest it's been and I'm not sure I'm even going to finish my degree.

62,@crustttttt,"Maybe the fact that this was recommended to me in this moment of my life, is an answer to a personal prayer; a wish granted for things to get better. Lamenting alone ny desires will gey nothing done. The last step hit the nail right on the head for me. The looping sense of regret and angst that nothing will change until I just perish is a poisoned drink I continue taking. ",Positive

64,@booklovingpoet5942,"This video made me realize so much about myself and some of these points described me so perfectly, it's crazy. It feels horrible to feel like you have no agency in your own life, and I got here by taking the path of least resistance from ever since I was a child. As my sister grew up, she shocked me time and time again by asking for things I wouldve never thought to ask, like for clothes and such, and let's just say that her childhood has been more colorful than mine up until this point(I mean that quite literally too) but she's shocked me in the many times where she managed to not become mild and people pleasing as a way of coping like I did, and I will always admire her for that. I was  jealous of her in that regard but credited it to her being extroverted and me being introverted but now I'm sincerely wondering if that's true.",Negative
